# 🌍 EarthquakeMap - Interactive Visualization of Earthquakes

## 📌 Description
EarthquakeMap is a **Java-based interactive visualization** project developed as part of the **Object-Oriented Programming in Java** Coursera course by **UC San Diego**. This project utilizes **UnfoldingMaps** to display real-time earthquake data on a geographical map, incorporating **sorting, filtering, and interactive UI elements**.

## 🚀 Features
- **🔎 Sorting & Filtering Earthquake Data**  
  - Implemented **Comparable** interface to sort earthquakes by **magnitude in descending order**.  
  - Integrated **custom filtering** to display earthquakes above a given magnitude threshold.  

- **🗺️ Interactive Map Visualization**  
  - Utilized **UnfoldingMaps** to display earthquake locations using **custom markers**.  
  - Different marker sizes & colors represent earthquake severity.  

- **⚠️ Threat Circle Calculations**  
  - Determined **impact radius** based on earthquake magnitude.  
  - Highlighted affected cities when earthquakes occur nearby.  

- **💡 Enhanced UI Interactions**  
  - Clicking on an **earthquake** marker reveals additional details.  
  - Clicking on a **city** displays a pop-up with the number of nearby earthquakes, **average magnitude**, and the **most recent quake**.  

- **✨ Custom Extension**  
  - Implemented a **new feature** to track and display **historical earthquake trends** over time.  
  - Integrated **additional data sources** for deeper analysis.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Java**  
- **UnfoldingMaps Library**  
- **Processing API**  
- **Geographical Data Parsing (JSON/XML)**  

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes
- Applied **object-oriented design principles** in Java.  
- Developed an interactive **data-driven application** using external datasets.  
- Gained experience in **GUI development, event handling, and map-based interactions**.
